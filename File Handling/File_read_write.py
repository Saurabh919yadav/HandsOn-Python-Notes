    Once you've opened up a file, you'll want to read or write to the file. First off, let's cover
    reading a file. There are multiple methods that can be called on a file object to help you out:
   
    Method                       What It Does
    .read(size=-1)               This reads from the file based on the number of size bytes. If noÂ argument is passed or None or -1 is passed, then the entire file is read.
    .readline(sieze =-1)         This reads at most size number of characters from the line. This continues to the end of the line and then wraps back around. If no argument is passed or None or -1 is passed, then the entire line is read.
    .readlines()                 This reads the remaining lines from the file object and returns them as a list.

    # read and print the entire file
    print(reader.read())

# Here is an example of how to read the 5 bytes of a line each time using the Python .readline() method:

with open('C:\\Users\\Saurabh\\Documents\\Github\\HandsOn-Python-Notes\\File Handling\\test.txt', 'r') as reader:
    # read and print the first 5 characters of the line 5 times
    print(reader.readline(5))
    # Notice that if the line is greater than the 5 characters and continues down the line,
    # reading 5 chars each time until the end of the line and then "wraps" around
    print(reader.readline(5))
    print(reader.readline(5))
    print(reader.readline(5))
    print(reader.readline(5))

# Here is an example of how to read the entire file as a list using the Python .readlines() method:

with open('C:\\Users\\Saurabh\\Documents\\Github\\HandsOn-Python-Notes\\File Handling\\test.txt', 'r') as reader:
    print(reader.readlines())
