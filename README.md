# Handson data structures and algorithms in Python

 Due to the corona virus outbreak I had to extend to my holidays at my home. I started to read different Python books and in this repo I have tried to include some of the things from them.

 I have tried include baseic implementation of diffeternt data types, classes and data models and different data structures and some important algorithms.

 Some of the books I have followed are Handson data structures and algorithms in Python by Basant Agarwal, Fluent Python by luciano Ramalho and Python notes for professionals. I will try to add more to this repo if something seems interesting.
