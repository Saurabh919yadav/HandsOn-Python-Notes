# Handson data structures and algorithms in Python

 Due to the corona virus outbreak I had to extend to my holidays at my home. I started to read different Python books andtopics from online reseources, in this repo I have tried to include some of the things from them.
 </br></br>
 I have tried to include basic implementation of diffeternt data types, classes and data models and different data structures and some important algorithms as well as some useful python modules. I created this repo for self knowledge but I have tried to add as much comments and documentation as possible. These codes are not a for the purpose of tutoring, So if you want to read about the concepts, please refer to the books.
 </br></br>
 Some of the books I have followed are Handson data structures and algorithms in Python by Basant Agarwal, Fluent Python by luciano Ramalho and Python notes for professionals and other online pyhton resources. I will try to add more to this repo if something seems interesting.
