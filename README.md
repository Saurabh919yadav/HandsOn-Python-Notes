# Handson data structures and algorithms in Python
Recently I came around this book and started reading it, this book is helpful for people who are intersted in implementing data structures
 and algorithms in Python.
 </br>
 Due to the corona virus outbreak I had to extend to my holidays so I have just tried to implement the codes given in the book. Codes have 
 not been written with the focus towards a reader. I have tried to include as much comments as possible but there might be some places where 
 you need to refer the book.
 </br>
 Book is very informative, so I would like to suggest this book to anyone who is looking to extend his knowledge of Python.
